# Understanding Kubernetes Architecture: Clusters, Nodes, and Components

## Introduction

In this lecture, we explored the **Kubernetes architecture**, starting with key terminologies like **cluster** and **node**, followed by a high-level overview of the components that make up Kubernetes' master and worker nodes. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding how Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications.

## Key Terminologies

### 1. **Cluster**  
A **cluster** is the heart of Kubernetes. It consists of multiple nodes (machines) working together to manage and run containerized applications.  

### 2. **Node**  
A **node** is an individual machine (virtual or physical) in a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes has two types of nodes:  

- **Master Node**: Controls and manages the cluster.  
- **Worker Node**: Executes the workload (containers and pods).

## Master and Worker Nodes

### Master Node Components
The master node is responsible for the control plane, which manages the clusterâ€™s state and workload scheduling. Key components include:

1. **API Server**:  
   - Acts as the interface for communication with Kubernetes.  
   - Accepts commands from `kubectl` or other tools and processes them.  

2. **Controller Manager**:  
   - Ensures the desired state of the cluster is maintained (e.g., replacing failed pods).  

3. **Scheduler**:  
   - Decides which worker node will execute a pod based on resource requirements and policies.  

4. **etcd**:  
   - A distributed key-value store that keeps the cluster's configuration and state.

### Worker Node Components
Worker nodes handle the actual workloads by running the containers. Key components include:

1. **Kubelet**:  
   - A small agent that runs on each worker node.  
   - Ensures the containers are running as expected.  

2. **Container Runtime**:  
   - The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).  

3. **Kube Proxy**:  
   - Manages networking and ensures communication between pods and services.

## High-Level Overview of Kubernetes Architecture

1. **Cluster**: A group of nodes (master and worker) working together.  
2. **Master Node**: Manages and controls the cluster.  
3. **Worker Node**: Executes workloads assigned by the master node.  
4. **Components**: Each component (e.g., API server, Kubelet) plays a vital role in Kubernetes orchestration.

## Conclusion

Understanding Kubernetes architecture is the first step to mastering Kubernetes. The components of the master and worker nodes work together seamlessly to orchestrate containerized applications, making Kubernetes a powerful tool for modern application management.
